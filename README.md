BeamNG - MDS (Malware detection script)
________________________________________________________________
INSTRUCTIONS
1. Identify the primary .jbeam file you would like to test. Make sure it is not a subfile.
2. Copy and paste the EXACT file name into the program after initializing. Ensure that the file extension is also present. For example, do not simply type "text" - instead type "text.txt".
3. Run the program. If the file is over 80% safe, the chosen file is safe to use.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM
This program automates the process in identifying malicious programs in BeamNG mods, specifically vehicles.
It tests whether or not crucial characteristics of a vehicle mod is present. If such characteristics are not present, it will raise suspicion.
If no common characteristics between a SAFE file and the SELECTED file are found, the program will recommend that the file NOT be installed.
